I am a student attending Cal Poly San luis Obispo who majors in biochemistry. I plan to use my degree as well as a minor in Environmental Science to create sustainable products that can help decrease the affects of global warming. Single use plastic is destroying our planet everyday and I believe that with hard work and determination we can help fix our mistakes and create a cleaner and more sustainable future.

### More Information

In my personal life I love to walk my dogs and spend time with friends. As well, I attend beach clean-ups to help keep our beaches trash free.
